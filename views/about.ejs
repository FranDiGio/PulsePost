				<h3 class="border-bottom pb-3">About Pulse-Post</h3>
				<p class="mb-4">
					Pulse-Post is a dynamic blog web application designed to allow users to engage with blog content
					interactively. Built with Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and Bootstrap, it serves as a platform for
					learning and showcasing full-stack development skills. This version focuses on core functionalities
					like post creation, viewing, editing, and deletion, with attention to detail on responsive and
					user-friendly design.
				</p>

				<h3 class="border-bottom pb-3">My Learning Experience</h3>
				<p class="mb-4">
					As an aspiring full-stack developer, creating Pulse-Post has been a significant step towards this
					goal. I've learned about server-side programming, templating with EJS, and the importance of
					responsive design. Tackling challenges such as implementing CRUD operations without a database has
					deepened my understanding of web-dev architecture.
				</p>

				<h3 class="border-bottom pb-3">Future Enhancements</h3>
				<p class="mb-4">
					Looking ahead, I plan to expand Pulse-Post's capabilities. Planned enhancements include adding a
					database for data persistence, integrating user authentication for personalized experiences, and
					perhaps developing a RESTful API to allow for more flexible data handling. Who knows!
				</p>

				<h3 class="border-bottom pb-3">About Me</h3>
				<p class="mb-2">
					I'm Franco, a Software Engineering graduate. Passionate about web technologies and creating digital
					experiences, I'm on track to become a well-rounded Software Dev. Pulse-Post is a stepping stone for
					showcasing my skills and dedication to learning.
