                <p class="mb-3">
                    Pulse-Post is a dynamic blog web application designed to allow users to engage with blog content
                    interactively. Built with Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and Bootstrap, it serves as a platform for
                    learning and showcasing full-stack development skills. This version focuses on core functionalities
                    like post creation, viewing, editing, and deletion, with attention to detail on responsive and
                    user-friendly design.
                </p>

                <h3 class="border-bottom pb-3">My Learning Experience</h3>
                <p class="mb-3">
                    As an aspiring full-stack developer, creating Pulse-Post has been a significant step towards this
                    goal. I've learned about server-side programming, templating with EJS, and the importance of
                    responsive design. Tackling challenges such as implementing CRUD operations without a database has
                    deepened my understanding of web-dev architecture.
                </p>

                <h3 class="border-bottom pb-3">Future Enhancements</h3>
                <p class="mb-3">
                    Looking ahead, I plan to expand Pulse-Post's capabilities. Planned enhancements include adding a
                    database for data persistence, integrating user authentication for personalized experiences, and
                    perhaps developing a RESTful API to allow for more flexible data handling. Who knows!
                </p>

                <h3 class="border-bottom pb-3">About Me</h3>
                <p class="mb-3">
                    I'm Franco, a Software Engineering graduate. Passionate about web technologies and creating digital
                    experiences, I'm on track to become a well-rounded Software Dev. Pulse-Post is a stepping stone for
                    showcasing my skills and dedication to learning.
